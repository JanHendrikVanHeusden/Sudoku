### Learning project
* This project started as a learning project for me personally, to sharpen my skills in Java and related stuff like unit testing & mocking (JUnit, Mockito), Maven, design patterns, etc.
   * Note that not all tests are unit tests, strictly taken. Some are integration tests. Others look like unit tests, but may use real (stubbed, not mocked) collaboration objects, which causes them to test state rather than behaviour ([see this old post of Martin Fowler about the difference](https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html)).
   Not really a problem imho, but some who are more strict may argue (with valid arguments!) that _all_ collaboration objects always should be mocked to make them strictly unit tests. I am a bit pragmatic here in that having things covered by tests is more important than exactly colouring within the theoretical lines, valid as they are.
   Anyhow, test coverage should be really close to 100%. One may notice that reported coverage figures are lower, the coverage tooling is tuned for Java but does not work very well for Kotlin... ðŸ˜®
   
* Later when starting with Kotlin I converted it to Kotlin, aiming to learn and practice techniques specific for Kotlin, like the Kotlin native support for Delegation, which has become one of my favourites, but also coroutines, mockk, and all other nice stuff that makes Kotlin "the better Java" imho!

* Because of it's learning goals I do not aim to provide the ultimate Sudoku solver. In fact, it probably will never be able to solve the hardest Sudoku's out there, simply because implementing all known solution algorithms, techniques and tricks out there takes more time to this aspect alone than I am willing to - there are other interesting things I'd like to do, especially with asynchronous parallel computation by using coroutines!

#### No 4 eyes principle
It's just my project. Not reviewed so far, and made by myself alone. So maybe I've overlooked some obvious ways to do thins, etc.; comments are welcome!

#### Current state
Currently, the solver is able to solve probably most or all Sudokus that you will see in newspapers, even those marked with 5 stars, and it was fun to program these algorithms / solving techniques.
But no, it still can't solve the really hard ones that you find on specialized Sudoku sites or in apps with really fiendish puzzles. These puzzles require techniques that may be not much more difficult to program, but the techniques themselves are not really obvious for non-mathematicians.

As this aims to be a coding exercise rather than the ultimate Sudoku solver project, I leave this for now, as there are several other coding techniques I'd like to explore!

#### What will be next?
* Instead of focussing on solving algorithms, the next thing will be applying asynchronous solution executiong by using **coroutines**, I'm really excited by the possibilities Kotlin offers here.

  * Until now I have the feeling that **even when applying asynchronous processing, there will be little or no need for explicit synchronization or guarding**.
  Due to the nature of a Sudoku puzzle, you never will have to increment a value (well, maybe except some statistics in future, which probably can be AtomicIntegers etc.).
  
  All mutable lists, maps and sets already use thread safe implementations like `ConcurrentHashMap` etc., and changes on these will always go into the same direction (e.g. candidate values are removed only, never added; and if a value is set, it will never be set again). Of course, when applying  parallel processing, threads may see stale state, but as I grasp now, this will never result to an invalid state.
  So I do not expect to need explicit synchronization or guarding.
  We will see!
  
* Maybe I'd like to build a **web frontend** for it. Would really like that! Maybe using something like ktor + Vue or maybe Angular. But no detailed plans for it yet, and zero experience in frontend developing!

* Would also be interesting to use an Amazon Web OCR Service to read a Sudoku from an image and load it into the tool - fancy plan, but imagination rather than realisation yet ðŸ˜‰

* More clear distinction between unit tests and integration tests
* Add mutation testing
* ... 

### Design patterns
Quite some commmon design patterns have been applied in this project, not just to see if it works, but rather the other way around: the things I wanted to program just asked for it

Design patterns in this project include:
 * **Delegation** - a very useful pattern and heavily used in the project! It's made so easy in Kotlin, if you compare it by the cumbersome and maintenance-sensitive way you have to do it in Java! Applause to the Kolin people!
 * **Factory** or some derivate of it
 * **Singleton** - not the one guarded by synchronization, but simply by static initialisation, so no thread safety headaches
 * **Observable** - out of the box with Kotlin, as a specific case of delegation.
 * **Visitor pattern** - not a very commonly used pattern, but it appeared very well suited for formatting Sudoku grid and its building blocks (rows, columns, blocks, cells) it consists of, it nicely separates the formatting from the model.
 * **Decorator pattern** - to decorate (literally!) a formatted grid with row and column coordinates
 * **Event based** - helps to decouple the solving part from the puzzle itself.
 * **Lazy initialization**, also natively supported by Kotlin (in fact as a specific case of delegation). Uhmmm... maybe we should call it a technique rather than a design pattern.
 
Some remarks on lazy initialization:
 * In some cases lazy initialization was simply necessary because the required value is not available yet when the object is constructed.
 Kotlin lets you define it as a non-nullable value with lazy initialization, if the lazy expresssion evaluates to not-null - nice ðŸ˜Š !
    E.g., grid and its substituents (row, column, block, cell) are highly coupled by nature, so `GridElement`, which is a supertype of row, column, block and cell, cannot reach grid properties during it's construction, and lazy initialization is simply necessary
 * In other cases, initialization is relatively costly, e.g. constructing maps and sets of properties for use by solving algorithms. Simple puzzles do not require these, so lazy initialization saves memory and computing power in these cases, as a means of optimization.

### Frameworks
I am not at all against frameworks, but I felt I should try first without, and see how far I could get.
So for the basics of the Sudoku solver project, I decided not to use Spring Boot as the program did not require it. The same is true for JEE techniques like depencency injection. In some cases, like supplying a Sudoku formatter, I chose to use a factory like pattern & some static methods instead. If I ever feel I'd add CDI or Spring Boot, these can be replaced easily by @Inject, @Bean or @Component.

So instead of relying on Spring Boot, e.g. for asynchronous event handling, I will have to build it myself, which will help me to master parallelism & asynchronous programming with Kotlin coroutes ðŸ˜Š

### Libraries
I use some common libraries like Apache Commons `StringUtils`, and for logging `slf4j` (with _log4j-2_ as implementation). And for testing of asynchronous stuff: `Awaitility`.

Less common is the use of [combinatoricslib3](https://github.com/dpaukov/combinatoricslib3), for generating combinations.
* I prefer its use of Streams above [Guave's solution](https://guava.dev/releases/23.5-jre/api/docs/com/google/common/collect/Sets.html#combinations-java.util.Set-int-) which uses Sets (forcing to keep all combinations in memory at the same time).
* Another combination util is [Apache Commons combinationsIterator](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/javadocs/api-3.6/org/apache/commons/math3/util/CombinatoricsUtils.html#combinationsIterator(int,%20int)), which features an iterator (so probably no need to keep all combinations in memory); however, this library accpts `int`s only, while [dpaukov's combinatoricslib3](https://github.com/dpaukov/combinatoricslib3) accepts any object type, which better suit my needs.
